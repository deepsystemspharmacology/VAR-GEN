The ligand for 4-1BB (4-1BBL) is induced on activated antigen-presenting cells including macrophages, activating T cells expressing 4-1BB. Mice lacking 4-1BB survive and have an altered though functional immune response. T cells of mice lacking 4-1BB proliferate more rapidly than normal T cells, but have reduced cytokine secretion. The costimulatory signal provided by 4-1BB may act in combination with CD28 activation to prolong the T cell response, and may also act independently of CD28. Stimulation of T cells with the 4-1BB ligand may provide a therapeutic immune response in the treatment of cancer or viral infection. 4-1BB in T cells activates several signaling pathways. Like other members of the TNF receptor family, the 4-1BB receptor does not have an intrinsic kinase activity. TRAF2 is a signaling adapter that mediates signaling by other members of the TNF receptor family and that also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of ligand activated 4-1BB to activate intracellular kinase cascades. TRAF1 also binds to the cytoplasmic domain of 4-1BB although with lower affinity than TRAF2. One downstream effector activated by 4-1BB through TRAF2 is the transcription factor NF-kB. 4-1BB also activates map kinase pathways, including p38 and JNK activation. ASK1 dependent pathways can activate both p38 and JNK, and dominant negative ASK1 blocks their activation. Other kinase pathways may also be involved in 4-1BB activation of p38 and JNK, such as activation of germinal center kinase (GCK) or related kinases involved in activation of JNK and p38 by TNF. Map kinase activation along with NF-kB activation results in transcriptional activation of cytokine genes involved in T cell activation and signaling. The co-stimulatory signaling provided by 4-1BB shares some features with CD28 signaling, providing an explanation for the ability of 4-1BB to replace the CD28 costimulatory signal in some settings."

Recent observations have provided a clearer picture of the interactive signaling pathways that emanate from the mature B cell antigen receptor (BCR) complex and the different precursor complexes that are expressed during development. Studies have also revealed that the net functional response to a given antigenic challenge is affected by the combined action of BCR-dependent signaling pathways, as well as those originating from various coreceptors expressed by B cells (e.g. CD19, CD22, FcgRIIb and PIR-B). It is now well established that reversible tyrosine phosphorylation plays an important role in regulating B cell biology. In particular, binding of antigen to the BCR promotes the activation of several protein tyrosine kinases (PTK) that, in conjunction with protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTP), alter the homeostasis of reversible tyrosine phosphorylation in the resting B cell. The net effect is a transient increase in protein tyrosine phosphorylation that facilitates the phosphotyrosine dependent formation of effector protein complexes, promotes targeting of effector proteins to specific microenvironments within the B cell and initiates the catalytic activation of downstream effector proteins. Studies have demonstrated that Src family PTKs are activated initially and serve to phosphorylate CD79a and CD79b thereby creating phosphotyrosine motifs that recruit downstream signaling proteins. In particular, phosphorylation of the BCR complex leads to the recruitment and activation of the PTK Syk, which in turn promotes phosphorylation of PLCg, Shc and Vav. Additionally, the Tec family member Btk is recruited to the plasma membrane where it is involved in activation of PLCg. Initiation of B lymphocyte activation is dependent on the tyrosine phosphorylation-dependent formation of multi-molecular effector protein complexes that activate downstream signaling pathways. The formation of such complexes was initially hypothesized to occur primarily via effector protein binding to the BCR complex itself. However, recent studies have demonstrated that productive signaling via the BCR is in fact dependent on tyrosine phosphorylation of one or more adapter proteins that play a crucial role in recruitment and organization of effector proteins at the plasma membrane. The SLP-65/BLNK adapter protein has recently been shown to play a crucial role in recruitment and activation of key signal transducing effector proteins in the B cell. After the BCR has been engaged by antigen and the activation response has been initiated, numerous second messengers and intermediate signal transducing proteins are activated. These include the production of lipid second messengers by phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and the PLC-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate to yield diacylglycerol and 1,4,5-inositoltrisphosphate (IP3). DAG is important for activation of PKC whereas IP3 promote release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum and the subsequent influx Ca2+ from the extracellular space. Numerous intermediate signaling proteins are also activated including the Ras and Rap1, which are small molecular weight GTPases and these ultimately lead to the activation of MAP kinases including Erk, JNK and p38. The net effect of second messenger production and activation of intermediate signaling proteins is the concerted regulation of several transcription factors that mediate gene transcription in the B cell."

Cell surface proteins on B cells receive signals from the exterior, adhere to other cells, and transmit signals to other cells. Antigen recognized by a B cell's immunoglobulin is presented in MHC Class II to T cells during B cell activation. Cell surface immunoglobulins are a key to B cell function, assisting in the response of B cells to specific antigen recognized by that cell's immunoglobulin. CD54 (ICAM-1) is an adhesion molecule involved in the binding of B cells to other cell types and LFA-1 is an integrin adhesion protein with two subunits that binds to ICAM. CD35 and CD21 are receptors for complement factors that stimulate the B cell response when complement is activated. CD80 and CD40 bind to T cell proteins (CD28 and CD40L, respectively) to provide costimulatory signals in the B cell-T cell interaction required for B cell activation. CD45 is a protein tyrosine phosphatase that regulates activation of B cells and T cells through dephosphorylation of signaling factors. CD32 is a receptor for IgG Fc, and is also called FcgammaRII. The number of proteins on the surface of B cell proteins indicates the complexity of regulation of B cell activation."

One factor that contributes to terminal keratinocyte differentiation is increased levels of intracellular calcium. Adding calcium to the medium of cultured keratinocytes elevates intracellular calcium and triggers differentiation. Intracellular calcium levels are also increased in response to phospholipase C activation, producing IP3 and releasing calcium from stores in the ER. Intracellular calcium alters multiple signaling pathways, one of which is binding to calmodulin to activate the serine-threonine protein phosphatase calcineurin. Calcineurin dephosphorylates and activates the transcription factor NFAT and both calcineurin and NFAT are expressed in differentiating keratinocytes. Activated NFAT can regulate transcription through binding its own cognate DNA binding site. One marker of keratinocyte differentiation, the p21 gene, is activated by NFAT by a different mechanism, with NFAT activating the p21 promoter by acting as a coactivator for the transcription factors Sp1 and Sp3. Another protein activated by calcium that may be involved in keratinocyte differentiation is protein kinase C (PKC). One substrate of activated PKC is MARCKS (myristoylated alanine-rich kinase C substrate). Phosphorylation of MARCKS by PKC in intact keratinocytes is not induced during calcium-induced differentiation, but does increase when tested in vitro. PKC activity is increased by calcium during keratinocyte differentiation but PKC MARCKS phosphorylation is blocked by the formation of a complex between calmodulin and MARCKS. The immunosuppressants cyclosporin-A (CsA) and FK506 inhibit T cell activation through indirect inhibition of NFAT activation and have several side effects including changes in the skin, suggesting that calcineurin activity may play a role in normal skin physiology. CsA is used to treat psoriasis, a disease involving abnormal proliferation of skin cells. The activity of CsA in treating psoriasis may involve inhibition of immune cells, but may also directly involve inhibition of calcineurin activity in keratinocytes."

Broader expression may indicate a broader role for CD40 and CD40L in immune function and disease states such as transplant rejection and HIV infection. Disruption of CD40 interaction with CD40L may prove therapeutic in the treatment of autoimmune disorders or heart disease and modulation of the interaction may in the future be exploited in cancer treatment. As a member of the TNF receptor family, CD40 relies on interaction with TRAF proteins to mediate an intracellular signal in response to CD40L binding. The pathway downstream of TRAFs activates the transcription factor NF-kappaB through a kinase pathway involving map kinases, NIK (NF-kappaB inducing kinase) and I-kappa B kinases. Some CD40 responses like regulation of immunoglobulin expression might be mediated by NF-kappaB transcriptional activation."

Activation of the complement system lyses bacterial cells, forms chemotactic peptides (C3a and C5a) attracting immune cells, and increases phagocytotic clearance of infecting cells. Complement can also increase the permeability of vascular walls and cause inflammation. Most complement proteins exist in plasma as inactive precursors that cleave and activate each other in a proteolytic cascade in response to three different mechanisms by which the complement system is activated, the classical pathway, the alternative pathway and the lectin-induced pathway. These three systems are distinct in the initiation of the proteolytic cascade but share most of their components and all three converge in the creation of a C3 convertase that cleaves the C3 complement protein, leading ultimately to the formation of the membrane attack complex, MAC, a pore causing lysis of cells. The classical pathway is activated by the recognition of foreign cells by antibodies bound to the surface of the cells. The alternative and lectin-induced pathways are both antibody independent. Proteolysis is triggered in the alternative pathway by the spontaneous activation of C3 convertase from C3 and is triggered in the lectin-induced pathway by the recognition of carbohydrates on the bacterial cell surface by mannan-binding protein, Mbp. In addition to providing a key part of the response to bacterial infection, the complement system can be involved in the response to fungi, viruses and protists. While activation of the complement system is a key part of the immune system, it must also be kept in check to prevent inappropriate or exaggerated responses. Twelve different proteins have been identified that inhibit complement activation to control the system, including Factor H, Factor I and C1 inhibitor. Deficiencies in components of the complement system have been identified in humans that cause a variety of immune related disorders. C3 deficiency is associated with recurrent bacterial infections, while a lack of C2 can cause antibody-antigen complexes to accumulate and cause the autoimmune disorder systemic lupus erythematosus. People lacking C1 inhibitor have also been identified and found to be prone to uncontrolled complement activation and dangerous swelling through production of C3a and C5a anaphylotoxins."

CTLs only respond to foreign antigen when it is presented bound to the MHC-1 expressed on the surface of all cells. CTLs do not respond to soluble antigen, but induce apoptosis in viral-infected cells and in cancer cells. When the complex of antigen bound to MHC-1 is bound to antigen-specific T cell receptor, the cytotoxic T cell induces apoptosis in the target cell primarily by two pathways, one involving perforin-mediated apoptosis and the other involving Fas/Fas-ligand interaction. When CTLs are activated by recognition of specific antigen on a cell, they release perforin proteins that integrate into the membrane of the target cell and organize to form a membrane pore. This allows the protease granzyme to enter the cell and activate the apoptotic caspase proteolytic cascade , and also allows other molecules to cross the cell membrane and trigger osmotic lysis of the membrane. The interaction of T-cell Fas ligand with the Fas receptor in the target cell can also activate the caspase cascade and other pathways involved in apoptosis. The interaction of a CTL with antigen-MHC I complex activates the CTL to proliferate and amplify the clone of T cells that respond to that antigen, amplifying the immune response against that specific antigen."

In response to binding its ligand SDF-1 (stromal cell-derived factor-1), CXCR4 triggers the migration and recruitment of immune cells. This ligand-receptor pair may also play a role in development of the nervous system. In addition to acting as a chemokine receptor, CXCR4 is a co-receptor for entry of HIV into T cells and ligands of CXCR4, including SDF-1 may help to block HIV infection. Early in the infection of an individual, HIV viruses often are tropic for the CCR5 coreceptor that provides for macrophage entry, then later in infection are tropic for CXCR4 and T cell entry. Viruses that are tropic for CXCR4 are generally syncitium forming, causing T cells to aggregate and be destroyed at a rapid rate. CXCR4 induces downstream signaling by several different pathways. As a GPCR, CXCR4 binding of SDF-1 activates G-protein mediated signaling, including downstream pathways such as ras, and PI3 kinase. PI3 kinase activated by SDF-1 and CXCR4 plays a role in lymphocyte chemotaxis in response to these signals. One endpoint of CXCR4 signaling is the activation of transcription factors such as AP-1 and chemokine regulated genes. JAK/STAT signaling pathways also appear to play a role in SDF-1/CXCR4 signaling. Delineation of the signaling mechanisms utilized by CXCR4 may assist in determining the role of CXCR4 in HIV infection and in the immune response."

Each of these cell types has a distinct role in the immune system, and communicates with other immune cells using secreted factors called cytokines, including interleukins, TNF, and the interferons. Macrophages phagocytose foreign bodies and are antigen-presenting cells, using cytokines to stimulate specific antigen dependent responses by B and T cells and non-specific responses by other cell types. T cells secrete a variety of factors to coordinate and stimulate immune responses to specific antigen, such as the role of helper T cells in B cell activation in response to antigen. The proliferation and activation of eosinophils, neutrophils and basophils respond to cytokines as well. Cytokine communication is often local, within a tissue or between cells in close proximity. Each of the cytokines is secreted by one set of cells and provokes a response in another target set of cells, often including the cell that secretes the cytokine. Some cytokines, like IL-1, interferons and TNF, stimulate a broad inflammatory response in response to infection or injury. Other cytokines have more specific functions such the following examples. IL-2 stimulates the proliferation and activation of B and T cells. IL-4 plays a role in the differentiation of Th2 cells, in allergic responses, and in the switching of antibody types. IL-5 stimulates the production and maturation of eosinophils during inflammation. IL-8 is a chemokine, a chemotactic factor that attracts neutrophils, basophils and T cells to sites of inflammation. IL-12 and IL-18 are involved in helper T cell differentiation. IL-10 apparently acts to repress secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. The complex interplay of these different cytokine functions with immune cells is essential for correct immune function."

Acute inflammation is an important part of the immune response, but chronic inappropriate inflammation can lead to destruction of tissues in autoimmune disorders and perhaps neurodegenerative or cardiovascular disease. Secreted cytokine proteins provide signals between immune cells to coordinate the inflammatory response. Some cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF act to broadly provoke the inflammatory response while others act on specific types of immune cells. Macrophages and other phagocytotic cells provide a front-line defense against bacterial infection. Macrophages stimulate the inflammatory responses of neutrophils, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells in response infection by secreting IL-1 and TNF. IL-1 and TNF cause fever through alteration of the body temperature set-point in the hypothalamus. Fibroblasts and endothelial cells respond to IL-1 and TNF by recruiting more immune cells to the site of inflammation. Secreted IL-8 is a chemokine that attracts neutrophils to sites of infection. Macrophages also present antigen to T helper cells that play a central role in coordinating immune responses. T helper cells induce clonal expansion of T cells that respond to antigen, with IL-2 as a key mediator of T cell proliferation and activation. TGF-beta is a negative regulator of proliferation in many cells, have anti-inflammatory actions in some settings. The cytotoxic activity of Natural Killer cells (NK cells) and lymphokine activated killer cells (LAK cells) toward viral infected or tumor cells is stimulated by IL-2 and other cytokines. T helpers secrete IL-3 and IL-5 to stimulate eosinophil proliferation and activation. Eosinophils are involved in the immune response to parasitic infection. T helper cells are required to stimulate B cell responses as well, with the cytokines IL-10, IL-4 and other cytokines regulating the clonal selection and differentiation of antigen-specific B cells to form antibody-secreting plasma B cells and memory cells. In addition to inducing activation and proliferation of specific differentiated immune cells, cytokines act on hematopoeitic stem cells, causing their proliferation and differentiation into the full range of immune cells."

Tissue injury stimulates the release of inflammatory signaling molecules such as bradykinin. Bacterial infection stimulates an immune response in several ways. Bacteria that are phagocytosed can activate macrophages, causing the release of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, TNF, and IL-6. Bacteria can also activate the complement cascade through either the antibody-mediated pathway (classical pathway) or the alternative complement pathway. In extravascular tissues, cells that respond to infection or injury include macrophages and mast cells. Macrophages and other immune cells secrete chemokines that recruit leukocytes from the circulation to the site of inflammation. Mast cells release histamine, prostaglandins, and leukotrienes that act as chemokines, increase vascular permeability, and act on the vascular endothelium to increase tissue recruitment of leukocytes. Chemokines can recruit leukocytes or lymphocytes out of the blood stream into tissues and make blood vessels more permeable. Leukocytes are activated by inflammatory signals to express adhesion molecules that cause them to interact with the vascular endothelium, penetrate the endothelial wall and migrate into the extracellular space of tissues. The combined response of immune cells and signaling molecules at the site of inflammation induces swelling, activation of immune cells, and clearance of potential infectious agents. Chronic inflammation can however also lead to tissue damage in conditions such as arthritis, in which anti-inflammatory drugs act on various steps in inflammation to prevent disease."

Mbp is an acute phase serum protein whose expression is induced by microbial infection. The binding of Mbl to microbial ligands activates the Mbl associated serine proteases Masp1 and Masp2, triggering the cleavage of C2 and C4 to create C4bC2a, a C3 convertase that cleaves large numbers of C3. Masp1 and Masp2 are similar to the C1 protease in the classical complement pathway. Once formed the C3 convertase cleaves and activates the remaining complement factors leading ultimately to formation of a pore in the bacterial membrane by the membrane attack complex (MAC) that lyses the bacterial cell. The lectin-induced pathway also appears to play an important role of the activation of phagocytotic cells by infection. Although the initiating event activating the complement cascade is distinct in the lectin-induced pathway, from the C3 convertase onward the lectin induced complement pathway is the same as the classical complement pathway. Since antibodies are not required in the lectin-induced pathway, this aspect of the immune response is part of the innate immune response. The importance of this pathway to the immune response has been demonstrated by the identification of children and adults with little or no Mbl who lacked normal phagocytotic responses and are highly susceptible to infection."

The polarization of T cells into Th1 and Th2 cells is associated with their expression of different subsets of chemokine receptors. Naive CD4 positive cells that have not been exposed to antigen express CXCR4 and CCR7. The most abundant chemokine receptors on Th1 cells involved in the cellular immune response to microbial agents include CXCR3, CCR1, CCR2 and CCR5, while Th2 cells express CCR2, CCR3 and CCR5. An additional class of T cells termed semi-nave cells may be induced by TGF-beta to express yet another class of chemokine receptors, CCR4 and CCR7. Although the expression of chemokine receptors in different cells is preferred in these cases, it is not absolute or exclusive, and there is overlap in expression between Th1 and Th2 cells. Although CCR7 positive cells have been reported to lack effector action, not be polarized, and to home only to lymphoid tissues, other studies have found CCR7 positive Th1 and Th2 cells and have identified CCR7 positive cells in non-lymphoid tissues. CCR4 appears associated with homing of lymphocytes to the skin, and CCR9 is associated with homing to the small intestine, while other chemokines like CXCR3 and CCR5 are associated with homing toward inflamed tissues more broadly. The expression of different chemokine receptors by subsets of T helper cells plays an important role in the migration and homing of these cells in tissues, and targeting of the immune response to specific cells."

In addition to activation of inflammatory cytokine genes like IL-1 and TNF, H. influenzae activates TLR2 expression and genes involved in mucus production. Hemophilus influenzae activates NF-kB by multiple mechanisms, starting with activation of the Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) by the p16 protein in the H. influenzae outer membrane. TLR2 plays a key role in innate immune responses and is expressed in high levels in lymphoid cells as well as low levels in epithelial cells. The role of TLR2 was supported by blocking NF-kB activation with a dominant negative TLR2 and increasing it with transfection of a normal TLR2 gene. TLR2 in turn activates TAK1, which activates two divergent signaling pathways. One of these pathways leads to IkB kinase activation, IkB phosphorylation and degradation, releasing the NF-kB heterodimer to translocate into the nucleus and activate transcription of target genes. In the alternate pathway, TAK1 also activates NF-kB through a Map kinase pathway, activating p38 and NF-kB in a nuclear translocation independent manner. Investigation of the mechanisms of H. influenzae signaling involved in NF-kB activation may provide the information needed to develop better treatments for inflammatory conditions caused by this pathogen. Other pathways modulate the role of NF-kB in H. influenzae pathogenesis. Glucocorticoids widely used as anti-inflammatory drugs increase TLR2 activation by H. influenzae through the NIK/I-kB kinase pathway, while they repress the p38 dependent activation of NF-kB. The repression of the p38 pathway by glucocorticoids occurs through activation of the MAP kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) which dephosphorylates and deactivates p38. Another aspect of the inflammatory response to H. influenzae infection is the production of excessive mucus, contributing to the overall symptoms of infection. NF-kB activation of the Muc2 gene contributes to mucus overproduction, in addition to H. influenzae activation of the TGF-beta receptor, activating SMAD transcription factors SMAD3 and SMAD4. Understanding mechanisms that modify H. influenzae signaling will contribute to further understanding the pathogenesis and treatment of ear infections and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease."

PKR phosphorylation of I-kB kinase activates NF-kB to induce transcription of inflammatory factors and stimulate an immune response that impedes viral infection. The PKR kinase is induced by interferon and some of the anti-viral activity of interferon may be mediated by PKR.

Th1 cells produce pro-inflammatory cytokines like IFN-g, TNF-b and IL-2, while Th2 cells produce the cytokines IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13. The cytokines produced by Th1 cells stimulate the phagocytosis and destruction of microbial pathogens while Th2 cytokines like IL-4 generally stimulate the production of antibodies directed toward large extracellular parasites. IL-5 stimulates eosinophil responses, also part of the immune response toward large extracellular parasites Th1 and Th2 are produced by differentiation from a non-antigen exposed precursor cell type, Thp. Exposure of Thp cells to antigen by antigen-presenting cells may result in their differentiation to Th0 cells, not yet committed to become either Th1 or Th2 cells, although the existence of Th0 cells is controversial. Cells committed as either Th1 and Th2 cells are called polarized, whether they are effector cells actively secreting cytokines or are memory cells. The stimulation of Thp cells by exposure to antigen-presenting cells induces the proliferation of undifferentiated cells, and their expression of IL-2 and IL-2 receptor. The differentiation of Th1 cells and Th2 cells depends on the cytokines they are exposed to. IL-12 causes Th1 differentiation and blocks Th2 cell production , while IL-4 causes Th2 differentiation and antagonizes Th1 development. IL-18 also induces Th1 differentiation. Polarized Th1 and Th2 cells also express distinct sets of chemokine receptors that further modify their homing and other cellular responses. Improved understanding of Th1 and Th2 differentiation will improve our overall understanding of the immune system, its response to infection and aberrant responses that lead to disease."

The crucial nature of helper T cells in the normal immune response is demonstrated by the severe immune deficiency associated with the HIV-induced helper T cell depletion. To communicate with other cells, helper T cells express a range of cell surface molecules, a few of which are illustrated in this figure. Like all T cells, helper T cells express T cell receptors complexed with the CD3 proteins that are responsible for the recognition and response of the cell to specific antigens. CD4 is commonly used as a marker for helper T cells, in contrast to cytotoxic T cells, which express CD8. CD4 is used by HIV to gain cell entry, as well as the CCR5 chemokine receptor. Thy1 provides a more general cell surface antigen used to identify both T helper and cytotoxic T cells. CD28 provides a costimulatory signal in association with the activation of the T cell receptor complex by an antigen presenting cell that is required for the T cell to become activated. Adhesion molecules on the surface of T cells assist in their interaction with other cells. LFA-1 binds to its ligand ICAM-1 in a variety of cells and T cells themselves also express ICAM-1. The CD45 protein tyrosine phosphatase dephosphorylates factors in the pathways involved in B cells and T cells activation. Although CD45 is required for T cell receptor activation, exclusion of CD45 from the local membrane region near the T cell receptor appears important for efficient T cell activation. Helper T cells can be subdivided further into Th1 and Th2 cells, distinguished by their response to different antigens, differing cytokine expression and expression of different chemokine receptors CD2 is required for efficient helper T cell maturation and stimulates their differentiation, but does not select for a specific increase in Th1 or Th2 populations of cells."

If the T cell response is too great and activation of self-responsive cells or unstimulated cells is not suppressed, then autoimmune disorders or tissue injury can result. Unstimulated T cells are maintained in a quiescent state and the activity of self-reactive T cells is maintained in an anergic state in which IL-2 expression is repressed. IL-2 is a cytokine with a key role in the activation and proliferation of T cells. The maintenance of T cells in the anergic or unstimulated state may not involve just an absence of activation, but an active repression of IL-2 expression, T cell proliferation and activation. TGF beta may play a role in suppressing T cell activation. Tob is a factor identified recently that represses T cell activation that is a member of a family of genes with anti-proliferative properties. Tob expression is highest in unstimulated and anergic T cells, and is reduced in activated T cells. Tob interacts with the TGF activated transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD4, increasing their binding to the IL-2 promoter, and helping to repress IL-2 expression. This role of Tob suggests that interference in Tobs function may lead to autoimmune disease."

Bacterial factors such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS, endotoxin), bacterial lipoproteins, peptidoglycans and also CpG nucleic acids activate innate immunity as well as stimulating the antigen-specific immune response and triggering the inflammatory response. Members of the toll-like receptor (TLR) gene family convey signals stimulated by these factors, activating signal transduction pathways that result in transcriptional regulation and stimulate immune function. TLR2 is activated by bacterial lipoproteins, TLR4 is activated by LPS, and TLR9 is activated by CpG DNA; peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) is activated by peptidoglycan (PGN). The downstream signaling pathways used by these receptors are similar to that used by the IL-1 receptor, activating the IL-1 receptor associated kinase (IRAK) through the MyD88 adaptor protein, and signaling through TRAF-6 and protein kinase cascades to activate NF-kB and Jun. NF-kB and c-Jun activate transcription of genes such as the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1 and IL-12. Several recent reports have suggested that the functional outcomes of signaling via TLR2, TLR4 and PGRP are not equivalent. For example, while the LPS-induced, p38-dependent response was dependent upon PU.1 binding, the PGN-induced, p38 response was not. The intracelular receptor for PGN, PGRP is conserved from insects to mammals. In insects, PGRP activates prophenoloxidase cascade, a part of the insect antimicrobial defense system. Because mammals do not have the prophenoloxidase cascade, its function in mammals is unknown. However, it was suggested that an identical protein Tag7 was a tumor necrosis factor-like (TNF-like) cytokine. PGRP/Tag7 possesses cytotoxicity and triggers intranucleosomal DNA fragmentation in target cells in the same way as many known members of the TNF family. Fragmentation of DNA is one of the characteristics of apoptosis. The possibility that in another system, PGRP/Tag7 would induce NF-kB activation, as observed for TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) receptors canot be ruled out."

Chemokines are small chemoattractant peptides that provide directional cues for the cell trafficking and thus are vital for protective host response. In addition, chemokines regulate plethora of biological processes of hematopoietic cells to lead cellular activation, differentiation and survival. The chemokine signal is transduced by chemokine receptors (G-protein coupled receptors) expressed on the immune cells. After receptor activation, the alpha- and beta-gamma-subunits of G protein dissociate to activate diverse downstream pathways resulting in cellular polarization and actin reorganization. Various members of small GTPases are involved in this process. Induction of nitric oxide and production of reactive oxygen species are as well regulated by chemokine signal via calcium mobilization and diacylglycerol production."

It results from various etiologies, both noninfectious and infectious, but coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is still considered the dominant etiological agent. Myocarditis may be caused by direct cytopathic effects of virus, a pathologic immune response to persistent virus, or autoimmunity triggered by the viral infection. The virus enters the myocyte through internalization of the coxsackie-adenoviral receptor (CAR) and its coreceptor, decay-accelerating factor (DAF). Viral proteases cleave various proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4G (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to apoptosis. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Viral infection and necrosis of myocytes may lead to the release of intracellular antigens, resulting in activation of self-reactive T cells. CVB infection is a significant cause of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as myocarditis. Epidemiologically, myocarditis underlies a significant portion of patients with DCM."
