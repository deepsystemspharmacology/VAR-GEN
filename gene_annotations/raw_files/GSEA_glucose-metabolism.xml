While insulin was long thought to be the major regulator of hepatic gene expression, emerging evidence show that nutrients, in particular, glucose and fatty acids, are also able to regulate hepatic genes. This diagram illustrates how glucose metabolite, rather than glucose itself, contributes to the coordinated regulation of carbohydrate and lipid homeostasis in liver through phosphorylation-dependent regulation of ChREBP (carbohydrate responsive element binding protein). ChREBP is a basic helix-loop helix/leucine zipper (bHLH/LZ) transcription factor, shuttling between the cytoplasm and nucleus in a glucose-responsive manner in hepatocytes. When serum glucose is elevated, glucose transporter (GLUT2) and glucokinase (GCK) allow for rapid uptake and equilibration of intracellular glucose levels. This flux of glucose promotes, via the hexose monophosphate shunt pathway (HMP Shunt), the formation of xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu-5-P), which activates protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) to dephosphorylate ChREBP (Ser196) and promote its nuclear localization. PP2A further dephosphorylates ChREBP in the nucleus, allowing it to dimerize with the bHLH/LZ transcription factor Max-like protein X (MLX) and activate transcription of a number of glycolytic and lipogenic genes containing a ChoRE, such as liver-type pyruvate kinase (L-PK), acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1 (ACACA), and fatty acid synthase (FASN). Upon starvation or high-fat feeding, intrahepatic levels of cAMP and AMP are elevated to activate protein kinase A (PKA) and AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK), respectively. PKA-mediated phosphorylation of Thr666 and Ser626 inhibits the DNA binding capacity of ChREBP; so does AMPK-mediated modification of Ser568. PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ser196 promotes interaction with 14-3-3 and thus sequesters ChREBP in the cytosol. In summary, the phosphorylated form of ChREBP is rendered inactive due to its diminished DNA binding capacity and subcellular compartmentalization. Glucose metabolism triggers dephosphorylation of ChREBP, allowing it to enter the nucleus and activate the transcription of both glycolytic and lipogenic gene expression in liver. The fact that ChREBP/ mice are intolerant to glucose and insulin resistant suggests that ChREBP may also play a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes."

The chemical energy contained in these foods is extracted and converted until it reaches a common form, the high-energy phosphate bonds of ATP. The hydrolysis of ATP is highly favorable and is coupled to a variety of energetically unfavorable processes to drive them forward. How is the energy of glucose captured and converted to make ATP? Most of the energy of glucose or fatty acids is extracted through oxidation to produce the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. From there, the energy is transferred next to the electron transport system associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane. This chain includes a series of protein complexes and non-membrane cofactors that transfer the electrons from NADH and FADH2 in a series of redox reactions from carrier to carrier. Oxygen is the final electron acceptor at the end of the chain, resulting in the production of water. The oxygen we breath, and which is transported by hemoglobin in the blood to all of the tissues, serves this purpose and allows electron transport to occur. As the electrons pass through the chain, they transfer their energy to the complexes, which use the energy to pump protons out of the mitochondrial matrix, creating a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The chemical energy that started with glucose, and was transferred to NADH and FADH2, is then converted to the energy of a concentration gradient. The inner mitochondrial membrane is impermeable to protons on its own, so the energy of the proton gradient is stable, waiting to be recaptured. The energy is recaptured by ATP synthase in the inner mitochondrial membrane. This enzyme allows protons to flow back down their concentration gradient across the membrane, and in the process uses the energy of the gradient to drive ATP synthesis. The movement of the electrons through electron transport, the proton gradient and ATP synthesis are all coupled processes that require each other to occur. The cell does not store energy as ATP, but only has enough ATP on hand for its immediate energy needs. If electron transport ceases or is inhibited, then ATP synthesis also rapidly halts. This regulation ensures that ATP production closely matches the needs of the cell. Glycolysis and the Krebs cycle are also closely linked to the energy needs of the cell. The abundance of ATP, NADH and pathway intermediates regulates key steps in these pathways so that are activated when energy is required to feed the electron transport system and they are inhibited when not needed to save metabolic energy. If oxygen is absent, electron transport and the Kreb's cycle rapidly halt, leaving glycolysis and fermentation as the main means of energy production. During aerobic exercise, the rapid consumption of ATP leads to use of the proton gradient to make more ATP, increased electron transport to regenerate the proton gradient, increased oxygen consumption, and increased activity of the Kreb's cycle and glycolysis to supply high energy electrons to drive electron transport. Uncoupling agents allow protons to flow across the mitochondrial membrane without producing ATP. The chemical compound dinitrophenol (DNP), for example, can transport protons to flow across the inner mitochondrial membrane without ATP synthase. In the presence of dinitrophenol, energy is consumed to pump protons out of mitochondria, but this energy is not recaptured in chemical form in ATP. Instead, this energy is released as heat. Dinitrophenol was once used as diet remedy to lose weight without exercise or diet, but this compound is a metabolic poison and resulted in deaths in when purposefully given to humans. Proteins also can act as uncoupling agents in the mitochondria. A mitochondrial uncoupling protein is found in brown adipose tissue. An increase in the activity of uncoupling proteins increases heat production by allowing protons to flow down their gradient without making ATP and may serve as protection against cold, as well as a potential means of obesity control."

Dietary carbohydrates include a variety of sugars that are funneled into glycolysis to supply energy, including other monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides like starch. Fructose is an abundant monosaccharide in fruit, and is also found along with glucose in the common disaccharide sucrose. Fructose enters glycolysis by different pathways in the liver and muscle. In muscle, fructose is a substrate of hexokinase, like glucose, and enters the pathway directly as fructose 6-phosphate. In liver, hexokinase is present in very low levels and fructose passes through a more complex pathway. Fructose is first phosphorylated to form fructose 1-phosphate, which is then split into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate to enter glycolysis as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate. The sugar mannose also enters glycolysis at this point, first being converted to mannose 6-phosphate that is then isomerized to produce fructose 6-phosphate. Lactose is a disaccharide found in milk, and is composed of glucose and galactose. Galactose only differs from glucose in its stereochemistry at one position, but must be converted to glucose to enter glycolysis. The first step is phosphorylation to produce galactose 1-phosphate. Then, a UDP nucleotide group is exchanged between galactose 1-phosphate and UDP-glucose. The result of this reaction is the production of glucose 1-phosphate and UDP-galactose. UDP-galactose is enzymatically converted to UDP-glucose, which is then converted to glucose 1-phosphate in the next round of this loop. Glucose 1-phosphate is isomerized to produce glucose 6-phosphate, part of the glycolytic pathway. The complex polysaccharides starch and glycogen differ in their source and in their structure (they have different bonds between each individual sugar unit) but they are both composed entirely of glucose subunits polymerized together. Starch is found in plants and is digested to release individual glucose molecules in the digestive tract that are absorbed and transported to the tissues. Glycogen is the main storage carbohydrate in animals, and is mobilized by liver and muscle to release glucose when hormones like adrenalin indicate that a burst of energy is required. When glucose is mobilized from glycogen, it is released as glucose 1-phosphate. In muscle, there is no enzyme present that converts glucose 1-phosphate to glucose, so the only fate of this glucose 1-phosphate is to enter glycolysis after being converted glucose 6-phosphate. Deficiencies in the enzymes that direct sugars into glycolysis have distinct clinical effects in some cases. Lactose intolerance is very common in many parts of the world, and is caused in adults by a reduction in the enzyme that breaks lactose down into galactose and glucose in the intestine. Some individuals suffer from the genetic condition galactosemia, in which they lack the enzymes to convert galactose to glucose. The accumulation of galactose leads to mental retardation, liver damage and cataracts unless dietary intake of galactose is controlled."

The glycolytic pathway is extremely ancient in evolution, and is common to essentially all living organisms. The earliest biochemical studies of glycolysis over 100 years ago used cell free extracts of yeast, in which it was observed that glucose could be converted to carbon dioxide and ethanol in the same manner carried out by intact yeast cells to make beer and bread. These experiments were the first to demonstrate that the reactions of life were not inextricably tied to living cells but could occur in a cell-free system, the foundation of modern biochemistry. In glycolysis, the six-carbon sugar glucose is oxidized and split in two halves, to create two molecules of pyruvate (3 carbons each) from each molecule of glucose. Along the way, the cell extracts a relatively small amount of energy from glucose in the form of ATP, 2 ATP molecules collected for each glucose molecule that starts down the glycolytic path. The pyruvate produced has one of three metabolic fates, to either become acetyl-CoA, ethanol, or lactate. When oxygen is available, the pyruvate can be converted to acetyl-CoA and enter the Krebs Cycle, where the acetyl-CoA will be completely oxidized and generate ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. Fermentation is much less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation in making ATP, creating only 2 ATP per glucose while oxidative phosphorylation creates 36 ATP per glucose in mammalian cells. Oxidative phosphorylation does not work in the absence of oxygen, however, and in the absence of oxygen glycolysis is forced to a halt due to a lack of NAD+, unless NAD+ is regenerated through fermentation. In yeast, fermentation allows the yeast to continue producing energy and survive in the absence of oxygen, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide from pyruvate. In mammalian muscle, strenuous exertion can create conditions in which oxygen is consumed faster than blood can provide it, forcing the muscle to use fermentation and create lactic acid in this case and make your muscles sore after a workout. There are ten enzymes that catalyze the steps in glycolysis that convert glucose into pyruvate, and the entire pathway is located in the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells. The activity of the pathway is regulated at key steps to ensure that glucose consumption and energy production match the needs of the cell. The steps along the pathway each involve a change in the free energy of the products and reactants, and as long as the overall change in free energy is negative, the reaction continues forward, like water flowing down hill to its lowest energy point. The key steps in the regulation of glycolysis, or any pathway, are those that catalyze the rate-limiting, irreversible steps along the pathway. In glycolysis in mammals, the key regulatory enzyme is phosphofructokinase, which catalyzes the rate-limiting committed step. Phosphofructokinase is activated by AMP and inhibited by ATP, among other regulatory mechanisms. Thus, when ATP is low (and AMP is high), phosphofructokinase will be activated and generate more ATP. Similarly, when ATP is abundant, phosphofructokinase will be inhibited to prevent wasting glucose on making energy when it is not needed. Although the glycolytic pathway was one of the first studied, it is still relevant to many issues faced in modern biology. Failure to provide energy can have lethal consequences for cells - the absence of oxygen caused by a stroke or a heart attack that prevents ATP generation can have lethal consequences for the cells involved. Cancer cells often generate energy through glycolytic fermentation more than oxidative phosphorylation, suggesting that manipulation of metabolism may provide a therapeutic strategy. Well known glycolytic enzymes such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase may play roles in other cellular processes such as apoptosis. Future studies may reveal additional functions of glycolytic enzymes."

This pathway is also an important source of biosynthetic building blocks used in gluconeogenesis, amino acid biosynthesis, and fatty acid biosynthesis. The Krebs cycle takes place in mitochondria where it oxidizes acetyl-CoA, releasing carbon dioxide and extracting energy primarily as the reduced high-energy electron carriers NADH and FADH2. NADH and FADH2 transfer chemical energy from metabolic intermediates to the electron transport chain to create a different form of energy, a gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy of the proton gradient in turn drives synthesis of the high-energy phosphate bonds in ATP, the common energy currency of the cell used to drive a huge variety of reactions and processes. An acetyl-CoA molecule (2 carbons) enters the cycle when citrate synthase condenses it with oxaloacetate (4 carbons) to create citrate (6 carbons). One source of the acetyl-CoA that enters the Krebs cycle is the conversion of pyruvate from glycolysis to acetyl-CoA by pyruvate dehydrogenase. Acetyl-CoA is a key metabolic junction, derived not only from glycolysis but also from the oxidation of fatty acids. As the cycle proceeds, the Krebs cycle intermediates are oxidized, transferring their energy to create reduced NADH and FADH2. The oxidation of the metabolic intermediates of the pathway also releases two carbon dioxide molecules for each acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle, leaving the net carbons the same with each turn of the cycle. This carbon dioxide, along with more released by pyruvate dehydrogenase, is the source of CO2 released into the atmosphere when you breathe. The Krebs cycle, like other metabolic pathways, is tightly regulated to efficiently meet the needs of the cell and the organis. The irreversible synthesis of acetyl-CoA from pyruvate by pyruvate dehydrogenase is one important regulatory step, and is inhibited by high concentrations of ATP that indicate abundant energy. Citrate synthase, alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase are all key regulatory steps in the cycle and are each inhibited by abundant energy in the cell, indicated through high concentrations of ATP or NADH. The activity of the Krebs cycle is closely linked to the availability of oxygen, although none of the steps in the pathway directly use oxygen. Oxygen is required for the electron transport chain to function, which recycles NADH back to NAD+ and FADH2 back to FADH, providing NAD+ and ADH required by enzymes in the Krebs cycle. If the oxygen supply to a muscle cell or a yeast cell is low, NAD+ and FADH levels fall, the Krebs cycle cannot proceed forward, and the cell must resort to fermentation to continue making ATP. Some Krebs cycle enzymes require non-protein cofactors for activity, such as thiamine, vitamin B1. Insufficient quantities of this vitamin in the diet leads to decreased activity of pyruvate dehydrogenase and alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, and a decrease in the ability of the Krebs cycle to meet metabolic demands, causing the disease beriberi. Although the elucidation of the Krebs cycle remains one of the landmarks of biochemistry, aspects of the Krebs cycle and its enzymes are still actively researched in the modern proteomic era."

It is a central pathway that produces important precursor metabolites: six-carbon compounds of glucose-6P and fructose-6P and three-carbon compounds of glycerone-P, glyceraldehyde-3P, glycerate-3P, phosphoenolpyruvate, and pyruvate. Acetyl-CoA, another important precursor metabolite, is produced by oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate. When the enzyme genes of this pathway are examined in completely sequenced genomes, the reaction steps of three-carbon compounds from glycerone-P to pyruvate form a conserved core module , which is found in almost all organisms and which often corresponds to operon structures in bacterial genomes. Gluconeogenesis is a synthesis pathway of glucose from noncarbohydrate precursors. It is essentially a reversal of glycolysis with minor variations of alternative paths."
